auto_greets.rb

Say greetings automatically when a user joined a channel, or a user changed
his/her nickname from what indicates the user is away to what indicates the
user is not away.

  Configuration
  -------------

  1. Create a file named ~/.xchat2/greet.conf and edit like below.
  
    greet_word            "hi"            # Greetings word.
    wb_word               "welcome back"  # Greetings word when a user comes
                                          # back within short time.
    delay                 5               # Seconds to wait after a user joined
                                          # a channel before say greetings.
    wb_period             60 * 60         # A period to assumed as wb.
    cooling_off_period    60 * 60 * 8     # A period to assumed as offline.

  2. List all nicknames to say hello to in ~/.xchat2/known_nicks.

    e.g.)
    tom
    john
    taro
